        <h2>Site: JavaScript Classes Tutorial</h2>
        <p>Classes are used to create one or more objects.</p>
        <p class="center">class &rightarrow; object</p>
        <h3>Two Kinds of Objects</h3>
        <p>1) Instance <u>Properties</u>: What they Have</p>
        <ul>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>age</li>
          <li>height</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2) Instance <u>Methods</u>: What They Do</p>
        <ul>
          <li>talk</li>
          <li>run</li>
          <li>jump</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To write a "class" in JavaScript we write </p> <br>
        <strong>
          <p>class Rectangle {</p>
          <p class="center">constructor() {</p>
          <p class="center">&nbsp; console.log("The rectangle is being created.");</p>
          <p class="center">}</p>
          <p>}</p>
        </strong> <br>
        <p>3) Now that you have a "Blueprint" (what we call a "class"), we can now create an
          <u><strong>instance</strong></u> of that class:</p>
        <p class="center">let myRectangle = new Rectangle();</p>
        <p>Inside the curly brackets of the constructor one can create either properties, methods, or both. Essentially,
          you add what the class will
          <u>have</u>, and what it will <u>do</u>. Notice the importance of the word "constructor." Also notice the
          special use of the word "this." with its period. It demonstrates javaScript's use of dot notation which allows
          program "chainning."</p>
        <p>class Rectangle {</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &rightarrow; constructor() {</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &rightarrow; this. width = 5;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &rightarrow; this. length = 3;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &rightarrow; this. color = "blue";</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <h3>So for Review:</h3>
        <p> class ClassName { &leftarrow;curly bracket</p>
        <p>&nbsp;contructor() { // This section is to list the things the object has with the prefix of "this."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.nameOfSomething = value;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;} // The next section in the class is for Methods--what the object can do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;walk() {</p>
        <p>&nbsp;This area is for code for the "walk()" method.</p>
        <p>} &leftarrow; Finally we close out the class with a closing curly bracket.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="section2">
        <h2>Adding More to The Blueprint</h2>
        <p>But here is a plot twist, when we write the <strong><u>constructor</u></strong>(), we can put something in
          between the parenthesis. Do you recall</p>
        <img src="/images/Class_1.PNG" width="400" alt="">
        <p>If we can enter values when we are creating the class, that would be a lot better for us. First, let me
          rewrite the class to better customize it to suite my needs.</p>
        <img src="/images/Revised_Class_1.PNG" width="400" alt="">
        <p>Next, as you can see, I have taken the liberty to instantiate from the "Blueprint/Class" of
          <em><strong>Rectangle</strong></em> the values 5, 3, and "blue" in the parenthesis. This is done with VS Code
          previewing my choices to me as I am entering data. But how can I be sure that my data was entered correctly?
          To answer that question I will need to examine the browser's development tools. I place my mouse cursor in the
          browser and right-click to bring up a drop-down menu. I choose <em>Inspect (Q)</em>. </p>
        <img src="/images/InspectBrowser.PNG" width="200" alt="">
        <p>This brings up the following:</p>
        <img src="/images/OpeningDevTools.PNG" width="400" alt="">
        <p>I make sure that "Console" on the top is selected and that I select only "Logs" from the buttons. So now I
          place my cursor to the right of the chevron in at the bottom of the page. I type in the name of the object I
          just instantiated, "rectangle1". The browser's tool immediately shows all my choices. I choose the one
          highlighted.</p>
        <img src="/images/OpeningDevTools2.PNG" width="400" alt="">
        <p>Upon selecting it, I can see its inner values.</p>
        <img src="/images/OpeningDevTools3.PNG" width="400" alt="">
        <p>I can get even more information by pressing the arrow key in the browser.</p>
        <img src="/images/OpeningDevTools4.PNG" width="400" alt="">
        <p>As you can see from the image above, "rectangle1's" data is correct. I am now going to add a method to the
          class called "area."</p>
        <img src="/images/areaOfRectangle2.PNG" width="400" alt="">
        <h3>Methods in the Class</h3>
        <p>As you can see in the many images presented there is an area in the class definition for "methods". Methods
          are actually functions that work just like the ones you learned in Algebra. In fact, if you look at the
          building of methods in your class, it will be helpful to consider its logic as if you were making a function
          using a TInSpire.</p>
        <p>Also, other computer languages define their function (methods) as if they were functions in math--take Python
          for instance. So just for review, a function, using a calculator is first defined:</p>
        <p class="center">define f(x)= 3x&sup2; - 2x + 5 </p>
        <p>It can then be implemented by replacing the x in the parenthesis with a value. By the way, the "f" in this
          function stands for "function" as it is an anonymous function. </p>
        <p class="center">f(3)=3x&sup2; - 2x + 5 then executes as &nbsp;&nbsp; 3*(3)&sup2; - (2*3) + 5</p>
        <p>So that f(3) = 26. But we are not limited to just x as variables or "f" as the name of the anonymous
          function. We can also give more meaningful names to our functions like "rate" for instance:</p>
        <p class="center">rate(a, b, c) = 3a * 2b<sup>c</sup></p>
        <p>Although we gave the function a meaningful name like "rate," we can also give the variables meaningful names
          so that people can have a better understanding of what the function does. However, since this is a review of
          my notes over the past 3 days, I will return to the subject at hand--that being JavaScript Classes,
          Properties, Constructors, and Methods (aka: functions).</p>
        <p>One other important scribble in my notes about functions has to do with the word "return." My notes say,
          always use this word <strong><u>return</u></strong> in your method or function. I'm not sure if I can actually
          do this but it is emphasized in my notes.</p>
        <h3>Another Example of a Class</h3>
      </section>
      <section class="section3">
        <h2>From the Coding Train</h2>
        <h3>The Arrow Function</h3>
        <p>Funny that my notes say one thing but my mind says another. Here I am again back on the topic of "Functions,"
          or, should I say, "Methods, and, "Anonymous Functions." The host goes through some of the ways thing were done
          in JavaScript ES5 such as the use of the special word "var" which has since be deprecated as everyone is now
          encouraged to use "let" and "const" instead.</p>
        <p>And so we come to the topic of the "Arrow Function" as a new way for JavaScript programmers to write
          functions, I am confused and a little disappointed because I like the use of the word "function." I even found
          the old way of writting a function:</p>

        <div class="boxForFunctions">
          <div class="flex-child magenta">
            <h4>Old ES5 Function</h4>
            <p>function Sqr(){</p>
            <p>return x * x;</p>
            }
          </div>

          <div class="flex-child green">
            <h4>New ES6 Function</h4>
            <p>let Sqr = () => x * x;</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>This function becomes an anonymous function (a no-name function). It is called by Sqr(x).</em> </p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-child pink">
            <h4>SideBar</h4>

          YouTube JavaScript tutorial videos.</p>

        <p>Although JavaScript is not necessarily an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language, it has many new
          features in its EA6 version that makes it act like it is an OOP language. As we have been practicing with
          making "Classes," we are also going to test-drive some of the new features that allow us to use Getters &
          Setters--a very OOP like feature.</p>

        <h3>#2 - Syntax Basics & Types</h3>
        <p>How do you enter data from the user into JavaScript? There are several ways. One way is through the
          "alert();" function.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; alert("Hello World!");</p>
        <h4>Sidebar: "Abstraction"</h4>
        <p>Put reusable code in : <u>functions</u> aka <u>methods</u>, and <u>subroutines</u></p>
        <p>We give our Function a name:</p>
        <p>But wait, have I not seen this before? Answer: Yes. Back in my college years, I worked with it everyday when
          I was learning algebra, trigonometry, and calculus. In fact, I was very excited to work with these concepts
          because I had just acquired this great advanced tool called the TInSpire CAS graphing calculator. It was no
          ordinary TI graphing calculator--it was a CAS calculator! The difference being that a CAS calculatore could
          solve complex algebra (and thereby, trigonomety, and calculus) problems. </p>

        &nbsp;
        &nbsp;

        &nbsp;
        &nbsp;
        &nbsp;
        &nbsp;
        &nbsp;This is like centering 20 spaces using &nbsp; <strong>{&amp;nbsp;}*20</strong> &nbsp; which creates 20
        space-bar actions.
        <p>By typing "<strong>{items $}*5</strong>" the html will display in the browser as: items 1
          items 2
          items 3
          items 4
          items 5. This is due to the dollar sign ($) telling the html to increment </p>

        <h3>Continue #2 - Syntax Basics & Types</h3>
        <p>As discussed before the sidebar (sorry), I left off here then my notes got illegible. I must of been too
          tired.</p>
        <h3>Other Things I Researched</h3>
        <p>Another thing I researched was the way JavaScript defines a class with its constructor, and the way C#
          defines its class with it constructor.</p>
        <div class="boxes2">
          <div class="column">
            <p>
              <h4>JavaScript Class Definition</h4>
              <img src="/images/areaOfRectangle2.PNG" width="400" alt="">
            </p>
            <p>Notice that JavaScript declares the object with either "const" or "let," while C# simply calls the name
              of the class, "Car."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <p>

            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Both languages initialize exactly the same way.</p>
        <h3>Yet Another Topic</h3>
